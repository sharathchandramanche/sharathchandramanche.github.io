             <div class="faq1">
             <p>
                This happens if user had created 2 or more user accounts with us. This can be easily resolved by disabling one of the user accounts. Please share with us the Name, Email and Phone Number that you registered with BookDoc for us to do the needful.

                <div class="faq1">
                    <p>
                    Regarding the SMS pin, we rely on a third-party service provider and sometimes there could be some disruptions in the SMS delivery. We hope to get it sorted out soonest possible.<br>

                    Please restart your phone and retry generating SMS pin again. Also please ensure that your internet connection is decent when doing so. <br>This step normally resolve the issue due to update of your carrier settings

               <div class="faq1">
                <p>
                    Normally the situation you described happens might be due to Google Fit Setting or you have multiple Google accounts stored in your phone, and the one associated with your Google Fit wasn't selected the first time when you tried to sync to Google Fit on our BookDoc App.<br>

                    For us to further assist you,please provide us some screenshots of your Google Fit - the home page so that we can see your steps.<br> Also click the top left menu icon on Google Fit and share with us the screenshot (there should be a side menu showing the associated Google account).<br>
                    
                    Meantime, please ensure the "Activity Detection" and "High Accuracy Location" in Google Fit Setting have been turned on

                    <div class="faq1">
                    Due to security for iPhone, every time when you open the BookDoc app, the syncing button will appear on the right corner of the Activ tab.<br> Please ensure that you let the syncing process to be completed before clicking onto the Activ tab.
                    <br> Remember to sync the data in few days gaps and especially on the last day of the calendar month.

                <button class="frequentlyaskedquestions">Why my steps in Samsung Health not tally with BookDOc?</button>
                    <div class="faq1">
                <p>
                    Our Average count in BookDoc and Samsung Health will be different.<br> Please refer below example:-<br>

                    Example:<br>
                    Day 1 - 1k steps<br>
                    Day 2 - 2k steps<br>
                    
                    Beginning of Day 3 (0.00am) - Samsung Health still 0 steps<br>
                    
                    On Samsung Health, average is calculated based on day 1 & 2 ==> 1.5k steps<br>
                    
                    On BookDoc, average is calculated based on all 3 days ==> (1k + 2k + 0) / 3 = 1k steps<br>
                    
                    But, BookDoc average will update as you start accumulating steps on day 3.<br>

                <button class="frequentlyaskedquestions">Which wearable device can sync bookdoc?</button>
                <div class="faq1">
                <p>
                    Wearable device that can share data with BookDoc App:<br>
                    1. Fitbit<br>
                    2. Garmin<br>
                    3. Jawbone<br>
                    4. Mi Band / Mi Band 2 (indirectly via Google Fit and data have to update in daily basic)<br>
                    
                    Our app started syncing with fitness tracking apps like Apple Health, Google Fit, Samsung Health and fitness trackers like Fitbit, Jawbone, Garmin due to their credibility and presence.<br>
                     As much as we would like to work with all brands, unfortunately there are many brands that either do not support integration with third-party app or their steps tracking is not very accurate.<br>

            </div>

               <button class="frequentlyaskedquestions">I recently change my workplace. How do deactivate it and where can i get new activation code?</button>
               <div class="faq1">
                <p>
                    If you wish to deactivate/change the facility/activation code or IC number/position, you can deactivate the code at BookDoc Setting,<br>
                    Click “Menu Bar” (Top Left) > “Setting” > “Premium Programme” > “Deactivate Premium Programme”.<br>
                    follow by reactivating again using the correct code and detail.<br>
                </p>
            </div>

               <button class="frequentlyaskedquestions">Why BookDoc not capture my steps from Gramin/Jawbone/Fitbit?</button>
               <div class="faq1">
                <p>
                    Normally we encourage longest 5 days gaps to sync wearable device (Fitbit/Garmin) data to the respective app.<br>

                    As for BookDoc app, for the historical 4 days, the data will only be updated overnight. The immediate sync happens for steps of the day only.<br>
                    
                    If the user only sync wearable device (Fitbit/Garmin) more than 5 days interval, there is a risk of losing steps for days older than 5 days.<br>
                </p>
            </div>

               <button class="frequentlyaskedquestions">I forget to redeem rewards for last month. Can you open it again?</button>
               <div class="faq1">
                <p>
                    We regret to inform you that the reward system only allows redemption in a fixed period of time i.e. the first 7 days of the redemption month.<br>

                    We have 'pop-up' reminders for the 1st day as well as on the last 2 days of the 'claimable period' on the App which is aimed to remind the Users to choose the rewards they plan to claim before the time-window ends.<br>

                    We acknowledge and would like to congratulate you for achieving your tier last month. If you manage to keep up the step-count trend until the end of the month, you should be able to achieve the same tier for this month and be entitled to claim the rewards in the first week of next coming month.
                    Kindly look out for the 'pop-up' reminders on the App within the 1st and 2nd last day of the coming month.<br>
                </p>
            </div>

               <button class="frequentlyaskedquestions">Why my Mi Fit and Google Fit not tally?</button>
               <div class="faq1">
                <p>
                    Our team are aware of the insufficiency when connecting Mi Fit data to Google Fit, and have highlighted to Xiao Mi multiple times. However, until they accept integration with any other external apps, there is very little we can do except relying on Google Fit.<br>
                    We Would like to point out here that Google Fit has its own flaws, and our technical team suspect that Google Fit normally discount some of the steps from Mi Fit because Mi Band is quite sensitive and tend to capture more steps than actual (e.g. simple waving of hands might be captured as steps).<br>
                    
                    Ultimately our programme aims to motivate users to maintain an active lifestyle and at the same time enjoy some special deals from our reward partners, so if there are ways our can improve our app and integration partnership, we will always stay up to date. We welcome feedbacks from our users to help improve the platform further.
                </p>
